So I immediately got in contact with SilkDawn. Mark from SilkDawn quickly launched an investigation into the lost bed frame. Mark kept in contact with me about the investigation but after a week they decide to send another bed frame via UPS. The bed frames are very heavy and I had someone bring them up two lifts of stairs. The bed is so comfortable I have not slept this well in years ... maybe ever.  The  gel foam mattress is so comfortable and I love the easy to use remote and the massage feature.
