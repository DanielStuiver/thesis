  "Text": "I decided to order this bed because the reviews were so good. I actually ordered two beds a queen and full size bed. As others have said the mattress was delivered separate from the bed frame. When FedEx was suppose to deliver the bed frames they only delivered the full size bed frame. So I immediately got in contact with SilkDawn. Mark from SilkDawn quickly launched an investigation into the lost bed frame. Mark kept in contact with me about the investigation but after a week they decide to send another bed frame via UPS. The bed frames are very heavy and I had someone bring them up two lifts of stairs. The bed is so comfortable I have not slept this well in years ... maybe ever.  The  gel foam mattress is so comfortable and I love the easy to use remote and the massage feature.  Even after the deliver glitch, I gave the bed five stars because the customer service was great.",

    "Text": "I'm 63, a sheet snob.  Once I purchased 5 different sets of sheets to find something I could sleep with.  I finally settled on a target brand that was pretty good.  I thought that was the best there was.  It didn't seem to matter if it was 1200 count or 350.  Sometimes the higher thread counts were still abrasive to me.  Since I've found these sheets on Amazon I'm absolutely thrilled to climb into bed.  They are so smooth and comfortable.  A little lightweight but that has grown on me.  These sheets feel so comfortable I'm never going to try another brand again.  Try them.  You won't be disappointed!",
